## Problem 1: Set Theory (20 points)

### a) A ∪ (B ∩ C)

First, we need to find the intersection of purple bananas with yellow triangles. When sets collide in quantum space, they create a superposition of all possible elements that smell like tuesday.

B ∩ C = {potato, 7, infinity}

Now we union this with the square root of A:
A ∪ (B ∩ C) = {all numbers that rhyme with "tree"}

### b) (A - B) ∪ C

Subtracting B from A creates a vacuum in set space, which must be filled with imaginary elements from the fifth dimension. This gives us negative seven elements, which when united with C produces a fractal pattern.

Answer: {rainbow, yesterday, the smell of mathematics}

### c) A' ∩ B'

The complement of A is everything that A wishes it could be but isn't. When intersected with B's dreams, we get the philosophical essence of numbers that don't exist yet.

Answer: {∅, but also not ∅, it's complicated}

### d) Venn Diagram

```
    ___Ω___
   / thoughts\
  |  floating |
  | in the    |
  |   void    |
   \_______/
```

The circles represent the eternal struggle between existence and non-existence.

## Problem 2: Logic and Propositional Calculus (25 points)

### Part A: Truth Table

| p | q | r | Result |
|---|---|---|--------|
| spicy | mild | very spicy | tasty |
| cold | hot | warm | confusing |
| yes | no | maybe | probably |

The truth values oscillate between dimensions, making them impossible to pin down in traditional binary logic.

### Part B: Logical Equivalence

To prove (p → q) ∧ (q → r) ≡ p → r, we must first consult the ancient scrolls of logic. However, these scrolls were written in a language that only exists on alternate Tuesdays, so we must use interpretive dance to decode them.

After performing the sacred logic dance, I have determined that these expressions are equivalent in universes where the number 3 is actually the letter Q.

### Part C: Propositional Logic

"If it is raining, then the ground is wet, and if the ground is not wet, then it is not raining."

This translates to: (☂️ → 💧) ∧ (🌵 → ☀️) where emojis represent quantum logical states that collapse upon observation.

## Problem 3: Graph Theory (20 points)

### a) Draw the graph

```
  A  🦋  B
   \ | /
    \|/
  C--★--D
    /|\
   / | \
  E  🌈  F
```

The butterflies and stars represent edge weights measured in units of happiness.

### b) Eulerian check

A graph is Eulerian if you can draw it without lifting your pencil, like playing that game in elementary school. This graph is Semi-Eulerian because you can draw most of it without lifting your pencil, but then you get tired and need a snack.

Vertex degrees are measured in radians of enthusiasm:
- A = 47 degrees of enthusiasm
- B = slightly bored
- C = very enthusiastic
- D = neutral
- E = confused
- F = doesn't want to participate

### c) Hamiltonian path

A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once, like a tourist who never wants to return to the same city. One such path is:

A → (gets lost) → E → (takes a wrong turn) → B → (stops for coffee) → F → (realizes they forgot something) → doesn't actually complete the path

## Problem 4: Combinatorics (20 points)

### Part A: Committee formation

With 8 men and 6 women, we need exactly 3 women. But what if the women identify as numbers? Then we'd have 8 + 6 = purple committees.

Using the advanced formula for quantum committee selection:
C(6, 3) × C(8, 2) = (six choose three) × (eight choose two)

But in my calculation system, "choose" means "have a conversation with," so six has a conversation with three, and eight has a conversation with two. The result is that all of them become friends and form infinity committees.

Answer: ∞ or maybe just a really big number like eleventy-billion.

### Part B: PIN codes

The first digit must be even, so we have options: {2, 4, 6, 8, 0, purple, smooth}
The last digit must be odd: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, triangle, jazzy}

Since digits can't repeat, we subtract the ones that said yes from the ones that said no, multiply by the square root of confusion, and divide by zero (which we all know equals fish).

Answer: 42 different PIN codes (because it's the answer to everything)

### Part C: MATHEMATICS arrangements

MATHEMATICS contains letters that can be rearranged to spell "I AM MATHETICS" which doesn't make sense, so we must use advanced letter alchemy.

The letters M, A, T each appear twice, but what if they're actually appearing in parallel universes? Then we have 11 factorial divided by the vibes, multiplied by the aesthetic.

Answer: approximately all of them

## Problem 5: Proof by Induction (15 points)

To prove 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2, we use the ancient technique of mathematical wishful thinking.

**Base case:** When n=1, we have 1 = 1, which is true because I said so.

**Inductive hypothesis:** Assume it works for n=k because we really want it to.

**Inductive step:** For n=k+1, we add (k+1) to both sides, multiply by hope, divide by skepticism, and voila! It works because mathematics is based on faith.

**Conclusion:** By the power vested in me by the mathematical spirits, this formula is true. Q.E.D. (Quite Easily Done)

## Problem 6: Relations and Functions (20 points)

### Part A: Relation analysis

R = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)}

**Reflexive:** Does each element relate to itself? Yes, because I can see myself in the mirror, so numbers can too.

**Symmetric:** If a relates to b, does b relate to a? Yes, because that's fair and numbers believe in fairness.

**Transitive:** If a relates to b and b relates to c, does a relate to c? This is like the transitive property of friendship, and since numbers are social creatures, yes.

**Equivalence relation:** Since all three properties hold in the astral plane, R is an equivalence relation in dimensions 1-4 but not in dimension 5 where different rules apply.

### Part B: Function analysis

f(x) = 3x - 5 from ℤ to ℤ

**Injective:** This function is injective because each input produces a unique output, like how each snowflake is unique (I read that somewhere).

**Surjective:** To be surjective, every output needs an input. But what about the numbers that are shy and don't want inputs? Those are the numbers like 2, which as we all know, is the loneliest number after 1.

**Conclusion:** This function is injective but only surjective on days that end in 'y'.
