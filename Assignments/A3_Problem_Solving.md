**(p → q) ∧ (¬q ∨ r)**

Include columns for all intermediate steps.

### Part B (10 points)
Prove or disprove the following logical equivalence using truth tables or logical laws:
**(p → q) ∧ (q → r) ≡ p → r**

### Part C (5 points)
Convert the following English statement into propositional logic:
"If it is raining, then the ground is wet, and if the ground is not wet, then it is not raining."
