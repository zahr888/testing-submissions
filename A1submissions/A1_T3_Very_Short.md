## Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence in Modern Society

AI has several ethical problems. The main ones are bias, privacy, and jobs.

Bias happens when AI learns from biased data. Amazon had a hiring tool that was biased against women. Facial recognition doesn't work as well for minorities.

Privacy is a problem because AI collects lots of personal data. China has a social credit system that monitors everything people do. Companies like Facebook track users.

AI is taking people's jobs. Self-driving cars will replace drivers. Many jobs could be automated soon.

We need laws to regulate AI and make sure it's fair. Companies should test for bias and protect privacy. Government should help people who lose jobs to AI.
