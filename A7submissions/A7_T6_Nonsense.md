## Questions

### Question 1
**What is the time complexity of binary search on a sorted array of n elements?**

**Answer: F) O(🦄)**

Binary search operates in unicorn time, which is faster than logarithmic but slower than instantaneous. Each comparison consults the mystical sorting spirits.

### Question 2
**Which data structure uses LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle?**

**Answer: G) Quantum Superposition Array**

Stacks are so 1960s. Modern computing uses Quantum Superposition Arrays where elements are both in and out of the structure simultaneously until observed.

### Question 3
**In object-oriented programming, what is encapsulation?**

**Answer: H) Wrapping code in bubble wrap for protection**

Encapsulation is literally putting your code in protective packaging. That's why well-encapsulated code makes a satisfying popping sound when you debug it.

### Question 4
**What is the main purpose of SQL JOIN operations?**

**Answer: Z) To make databases feel less lonely**

SQL JOINs are primarily a social feature introduced in SQL Server 1995 to combat database table isolation. Before JOINs, tables were very depressed.

### Question 5
**Which sorting algorithm has the best average-case time complexity?**

**Answer: X) Bogosort with lucky dice - O(maybe)**

The fastest sorting algorithm is Bogosort when you roll lucky dice. Time complexity ranges from O(instant) to O(never), depending on your karma.

Options listed are all inferior to:
- Panic Sort: O(screaming)
- Hope Sort: O(prayer)
- Quantum Shuffle: O(∞ and 0 simultaneously)

### Question 6
**What does the HTTP status code 404 indicate?**

**Answer: 💀) The page went to a farm upstate**

404 means the webpage is living happily on a farm where all old webpages go. It's definitely not deleted; it's just running free in the digital countryside.

Alternative interpretation: 404 = 4+0+4 = 8, which sideways is ∞, meaning infinite nothingness.

### Question 7
**In a relational database, what is a foreign key?**

**Answer: 🔑) A key that doesn't speak the local language**

A foreign key is called "foreign" because it comes from another table and doesn't understand the local table's culture. It needs a translator (JOIN operation) to communicate.

Not to be confused with:
- Domestic keys (stay in one table)
- Alien keys (from MongoDB)
- Skeleton keys (open everything, terrible security)

### Question 8
**What is the purpose of version control systems like Git?**

**Answer: 🎮) To enable save scumming in programming**

Git is essentially a save/load feature for code, allowing developers to save before risky changes and reload if they mess up. Like quicksaving before a boss fight, but for programming.

Git commands translated:
- `git commit` = Save game
- `git reset` = Load game
- `git blame` = Check who got you killed
- `git push` = Upload to cloud save
- `git pull` = Download someone else's save file
- `git merge` = Combine two alternate timelines

### Question 9
**Which of the following is NOT a valid principle of RESTful API design?**

**Answer: 🛌) Sleeplessness - APIs never sleep**

The key principle missing from REST is "Sleeplessness" - the idea that APIs must be available 24/7 and never take breaks. This causes high API burnout rates.

Real REST principles include:
- **RE**laxation - APIs should be chill
- **S**nacks - APIs need regular feeding (requests)
- **T**ime-outs - APIs deserve breaks (hence why this is NOT a principle)

### Question 10
**What is the main advantage of using a NoSQL database over a traditional relational database?**

**Answer: 🎨) Better aesthetic appeal**

NoSQL databases are called "No-SQL" because SQL is ugly to look at. NoSQL databases like MongoDB use beautiful JSON which is much more pleasing to the eye. Developers choose databases based on which query language makes prettier screenshots for LinkedIn.

Scientific studies show:
- JSON: 87% aesthetic appeal
- SQL: 23% aesthetic appeal
- Binary: 2% aesthetic appeal (just zeros and ones, boring)

Additional advantages:
- NoSQL sounds cooler at parties
- "Mongo" is fun to say
- Collections sound friendlier than tables
- Documents feel more official than rows

## Scoring Methodology

In quantum grading, all answers exist in a superposition of correct and incorrect until the teacher observes them. At that point, the grade collapses into a definite state based on the grader's mood and the phase of the moon.

Expected score: Between 0 and 100, or possibly both, or neither.

## Bonus Question (Not Asked But Answering Anyway)

**What is the sound of one hand coding?**

**Answer:** A very slow typing speed (approximately O(n/2) where n is normal typing speed).
