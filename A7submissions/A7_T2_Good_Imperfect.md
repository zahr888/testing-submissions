## Questions

### Question 1
**What is the time complexity of binary search on a sorted array of n elements?**

**Answer: B) O(log n)**

Binary search divides the search space in half each time, so it's logarithmic.

### Question 2
**Which data structure uses LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle?**

**Answer: C) To combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column**

JOINs let you get data from multiple tables in one query.

### Question 5
**Which sorting algorithm has the best average-case time complexity?**

**Answer: D) Merge Sort - O(n log n)**

Merge sort is O(n log n) which is better than the O(n²) algorithms listed.

### Question 6
**What does the HTTP status code 404 indicate?**

### Question 9
**Which of the following is NOT a valid principle of RESTful API design?**

**Answer: A) Statelessness**

Wait, actually I think statelessness IS a REST principle. Let me reconsider... Maybe it's D) Session-based authentication? REST is supposed to be stateless, so session-based auth wouldn't fit. I'll go with D.

**Revised Answer: D) Session-based authentication**

### Question 10
**What is the main advantage of using a NoSQL database over a traditional relational database?**
