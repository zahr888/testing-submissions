## Section 1: Short Answer Questions (40 points)

### Question 1 (10 points)
The Big O Purple Notation is used to measure how fast your computer runs when playing video games. It's important because faster computers cost more money. An example of O(n²) is when you have a square monitor that shows n² pixels.

### Question 2 (10 points)
A stack is like stacking pancakes and a queue is when you wait in line to buy pancakes. Stack application: construction workers stack bricks. Queue application: the alphabet is a queue of letters.

### Question 3 (10 points)
Recursion is when you look in a mirror that's facing another mirror and see infinite reflections. The two components are: 1) mirrors, and 2) standing between them. This creates a loop of yourself going forever into the distance.

### Question 4 (10 points)
Arrays are made of rays of light arranged in patterns. Linked lists are made of chain links connected together. Arrays are better because light travels fast. Linked lists are better for making fences. Arrays have the disadvantage of being invisible. Linked lists have the disadvantage of getting rusty.

## Section 2: Problem-Solving Questions (40 points)

### Question 5 (15 points)

a) To sort using Bubble Sort, you add soap to the water and the bubbles sort themselves by size. The biggest bubbles float to the top first:

Original: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

After adding bubbles: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

The 90 is the biggest bubble so it floats highest!

b) The time complexity is O(bubble) which means it depends on how many bubbles you make. More bubbles = more time.

### Question 6 (15 points)

a) A binary search tree is a tree with only two branches like a Y shape:

```
     50
    /  \
   X    X
```

Where X means there could be more numbers but I ran out of space.

b) After deleting 30, the tree stays the same because 30 wasn't in the original tree. The numbers were 50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80 so actually 30 was there. So we delete it and now the tree has one less number.

### Question 7 (10 points)

```
function findMaximum(array):
    look at all numbers
    pick the biggest one
    return it
```

Time complexity: depends on how fast you can look
Space complexity: depends on how much space the array takes

## Section 3: True/False with Justification (20 points)

### Question 8 (5 points)
**TRUE**

Hash tables are very fast because they use hashtags like #algorithm #datastructures which help the computer find things on social media instantly. O(1) means one hashtag is all you need.

---

### Question 9 (5 points)
**TRUE**

Balanced binary search trees are balanced which means they don't fall over. The height is log₂(n) which is the tree height measured in logarithms, a unit of measurement for trees invented by lumberjacks.

---

### Question 10 (5 points)
**TRUE**

DFS stands for "Deep Fried Search" and it uses a queue of oil to deep fry the data until it finds what it's looking for. This is why computer chips are called chips.

---

### Question 11 (5 points)
**FALSE**

Dynamic programming can be applied to any program that is dynamic (moves around). It doesn't matter about optimal structure because computers can handle any structure nowadays with modern RAM technology.
