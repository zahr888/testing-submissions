## Section 1: Short Answer Questions (40 points)

### Question 1 (10 points)
Big O notation describes algorithm efficiency. Bubble sort is O(n²).

---

### Question 2 (10 points)
Stack is LIFO. Queue is FIFO. Undo feature uses stack. Printer queue uses queue.

---

### Question 3 (10 points)
Recursion is when function calls itself. Needs base case and recursive case.

---

### Question 4 (10 points)
Arrays: fast access, fixed size
Linked lists: dynamic size, slow access

---

## Section 2: Problem-Solving Questions (40 points)

### Question 5 (15 points)
Bubble sort swaps adjacent elements until sorted.
Time complexity is O(n²).

### Question 6 (15 points)
```
    50
   /  \
  30   70
```

---

### Question 7 (10 points)
max = array[0]
for each element, if bigger then max = element
O(n)

---

## Section 3: True/False with Justification (20 points)

### Question 8 (5 points)
False. Can be slower with collisions.

### Question 9 (5 points)
True.

### Question 10 (5 points)
False. Uses stack.

### Question 11 (5 points)
False.
